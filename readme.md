## Snes9x for 3DS

Snes9x for 3DS is a high-compatibility SNES emulator for your Old 3DS / 2DS. It runs many games at full speed (60 fps). It supports games that use CX4 chip (Megaman X2/X3), and the SDD-1 chip (Star Ocean, Super Street Fighter 2 Alpha). It can also play games that use the SuperFX chip (Yoshi's Island, etc), and the SA-1 chip (Super Mario RPG, Kirby's Dreamland, Kirby Super Star) but it runs slowly. It generally supports higher compatibility than existing SNES emulators on the old 3DS, because it uses Snes9x 1.43 as a base, and is a good alternative if your existing emulators cannot play all games.

It also runs on your New 3DS, and performs much faster! Use your New 3DS if you want to play SuperFX and SA-1 games!
